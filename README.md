WIP rust models of [VRChat](https://store.steampowered.com/app/438100/VRChat/)'s API.

This is fully unofficial and in no way affiliated, endorsed, supported, or created by VRChat.

Huge shoutout to the MIT licensed [vrchatapi](https://vrchatapi.github.io), which this crate borrows a lot from.
If you're looking for a more mature project, please consider looking at their [generated rust crate](https://github.com/vrchatapi/vrchatapi-rust) instead.

I disliked the generated nature of it though, and wanted more strong Rust-like things for some things, which is why this crate exists.

## License

Note that the license is `MPL-2.0` instead of the more common `MIT OR Apache-2.0`.
A license change however can be negotiated if the ABI team wants to use this crate or adopt this crate into a more official one with a different license.
